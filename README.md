CODE REFRACTOR CHALLENGE:



This project is called code refractor

One of the purpose of this project was to change the HTML semantics in a proper way (i.e delete divs).

The challenge was for this exercice to adjust the css code with the new HTML semantic.

We needed to organize better the code in a more logical structure both in the css stylesheet and in the html index

We also needed to put some alt attributes with the images, have a proper display of the heading attributes and of the title elements that needed to follow a sequential order.

Finally we had to find a unique name for the project in order to be original.
